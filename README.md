# Context-based-Recommeder-System
Aim of this project was to design a recommendation system which considers the contexts like time, location etc. to recommend movies to the users. Also empirical comparison between traditional recommendation systems and contextual recommendation systems is done. N-D tensors are used, instead of using traditional 2-D matrix.

Implementation
Open 3DReccFinal.py. Comments are there to explain you.
